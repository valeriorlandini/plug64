# Plug64

Plug 64 is a collection of simple audio plugins supporting up to 64 channels and per-channel operations. Plugins are available in VST3/LV2/AU formats and as standalone, for Windows, Linux and macOS. The motivation behind these plugins was the need, for my personal projects, of processors able to do some simple operations (like adjusting the gain or applying a filter) on an arbitrary number of channels, without having to load any big CPU-intensive plugin.
Moreover, these plugins allow not only to apply a master effect on all the channels, but to apply the same effect on each channel with different values. All the parameters are of course automatable.

Currently included plugins are (more coming soon!):
